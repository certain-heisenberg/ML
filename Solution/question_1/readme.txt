Please check the attached NOTEBOOK. I have mentioned all important discussion and decription within it.
However here is summary:
I have implemented CNN with keras module from tensorflow in this question. For this I have
-> first preprocessed the data and stored images and corresponding labels in separate lists
-> splitted data into train and test sets of 80:20 ratio
-> built a CNN model using Keras and checked for accuracy
-> predicted the labels on test images
